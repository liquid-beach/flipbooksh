# flipbooksh
skull.sh is an art program I created to display ASCII animations in the terminal. 
It creates a loop with bash that prints ASCII data to the terminal, clears it and plays the next image like a flipbook.
skull.sh is an animation of a smiling skull and cross bones.  To run make sure permissions are correct with "sudo chmod +x skull.sh" then run with the command "bash skull.sh" you can adjust your terminal size and font size for your situation.
